Clustering model for opening a gymnasium in chicago


Suppose we would like to open a new Gymnasium in the city and start a new business . We may apply machine learning algorithm to find out which area could be best fit to choose a location.In this project city of Chicago data to find out location in each area and also gyms currently present there. I am planning to figure out population per gym in area. And then apply clustering model to identify areas on map where population per gym is high and having new gym could be more successful.
